/**
 *  Nothing to do when updating to 0.97 except updating the version itself.
 * Everything else is done by Hibernate.
 * 
 * ATTENTION: 
 * 
 * Since DB version 0.97 the inheritance mapping for the CnaTreeelement class hierarchy
 * is moved into a single table. The table BSIModel is no longer used. 
 * If this table is still present from an older DB and still contains a DB version 
 * number IT IS NOT BEING USED and can be removed.
 * 
 * To find out the current DB version you have to check the CnATreeElement table, i.e.:
 * "select * from cnatreeelement where dbVersion is not null;"
