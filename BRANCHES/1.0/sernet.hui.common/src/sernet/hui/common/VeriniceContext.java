/**
 * This class is a crucial helper to make accessing certain beans (the work objects)
 * possible that once were singletons.
 * 
 * <p>Note: Direct access to this class' methods is only for infrastructure
 * classes (e.g. generic superclasses etc.).</p>
 *  
 * <p>The problem that this class solves is the following: In earlier versions of
 * verinice the application was either run as server or client. Depending on the
 * startup certain classes where instantiated as singletons (e.g. HUITypeFactory).
 * The rest of the application frequently accessed those singletons.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As of now the verinice server and client application can run inside the same
 * virtual machine. The effect was that the above mentioned singletons where then
 * always configured for the client since it was started last (former objects 
 * were replaced).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Since the server and client functionality never share a common thread the
 * idea was to use a thread local variable to let the application either access
 * the beans that have been configured for the client or the ones that were
 * configured for the server.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class wraps the access to the thread local variable and allows static
 * methods like {@link HUITypeFactory#getInstance()} to retrieve the correct
 * instance for the server or the client.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To make this work correctly a little bit of housekeeping is neccessary. Again
 * this class makes the housekeeping easy: Everytime code is executed on a new
 * (or foreign) thread you need to initialize the thread local variable. To do
 * this retrieve the so-called state of the <code>VeriniceContext</code> by
 * calling {@link #getState()} when you are still on a thread where the thread
 * local variable is already initialized. A suitable place for this is the
 * constructor of a worker class. When the processing in the new thread begins
 * put the state into the context by calling {@link #setState(State)}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The context/thread local variable is initialized by the activator class
 * of the verinice client and by the <code>ServerInitializer</code> class of
 * the verinice server.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: The introduction of the thread-local variable is more a hack than
 * a solution. However doing it right would involve massive changes to the
 * applications design (many many classes would need to be managed by the
 * Spring IoC container).</p>
