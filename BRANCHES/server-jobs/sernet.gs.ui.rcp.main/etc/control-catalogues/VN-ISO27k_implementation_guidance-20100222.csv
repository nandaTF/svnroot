,,,"Prepared by the international community of ISO27k implementers at ISO27001security.com Version 1.1 19th November 2007"
,,,
,,,"Introduction"
,,,"This is a collaborative document created by ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 implementers belonging to the ISO27k implementers' forum. We wanted to document and share some pragmatic tips for implementing the information security management standards, plus potential metrics for measuring and reporting the status of information security, both referenced against the ISO/IEC standards."
,,,
,,,"Scope"
,,,"This guidance covers all 39 control objectives listed in sections 5 through 15 of ISO/IEC 27002 plus, for completeness, the preceding section 4 on risk assessment and treatment."
,,,
,,,"Purpose"
,,,"This document is meant to help others who are implementing or planning to implement the ISO/IEC information security management standards. Like the ISO/IEC standards, it is generic and needs to be tailored to your specific requirements."
