      Perspective</b>.

    <description>
      Double-click the first question to open the editor. Simultaneously, the Object Browser will
      show the question and a selection of maturity levels.
      <br /><br />
      Read the descriptions to decide which maturity level you have reached in your organization.
      You may have to consult other employees or do some internal research to answer the question
      correctly.
      <br /><br />
      Choose the correct maturity level in the editor below the browser view. You can add a public and
      a private comment. The public comment will be included in a database export. Private comments are
      just for yourself. They never leave your local database.

      party, which you can then send them via email or other means. You can do so by selecting
      <b>File > Generate Report...</b>.

      file</b>.
      <br /><br />
