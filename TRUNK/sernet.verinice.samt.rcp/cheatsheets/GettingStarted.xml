First you have to create a new self assessment. You should be in the self assessment perspective. 
If not, you can go there by choosing from the menu:
            <b>View -> Show Perspective... -> Self-Assessment Perspective</b>.
            
            You will find the Self-Assessment view on left side of the Window.

        Click the <b>NEW</b> button in the self-assessment view or choose from
        the menu: <b>File -> Add new Self-Assessment</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The new self-assessment will appear in the view. Double-click on it
        to bring up the editor view. Change the name from "My Company" to your actual company's name.
        <br/><br/>

        by clicking the small arrow to the left of the node's icon. Expand "Controls" and then the first category by clicking the small arrow on the left.
        <br/><br/>
        You should be able to see a
        number of categories from "Security Policy" to "Access Control". These
        categories contain questions that will help you to evaluate your current
        information security level for the most important topics.

    <item title="Answering questions">
    <description>
        Double-click on the first question to open the editor.
        Simultaneously, the Control Browser will show you the question and a selection of maturity levels.
        <br/><br/>
        Read the descriptions to decide which maturity level you have reached in your organization. You may have to consult 
        other employees or do some internal research to answer the question correctly. 
        <br/>
        Choose the correct maturity level in the editor below the browser view. You can also add a public comment. This comment
        will be included in a database export. You can also add a private comment just for yourself. The private comment 
        will always stay in your local database.
        <br/><br/>
        Save cour changes by pressing <b>Strg-S</b> or by choosing <b>File -> Save</b>.

    <item title="Generate a report">
      <description>
        Continue in the same way with the next question. As you go along, you will notice
        that the spider chart in the bottom left corner of the screen begins to reflect your answers. When you have answered all questions honestly, you
        will have a good overview about your current information security situation.
        <br/><br/>
        When you are done answering all questions, you may want to generate a report for management or another party. You can do so by choosing
        <b>File -> Self-Assessment -> Generate Report...</b>.
        <br/><br/>
        Choose the type of report and a filename under which the report should be saved, then click OK.

    <item title="Export results">
      <description>
        When you are done answering all questions, you can export your results to send them to another party.
        You can do so by choosing <b>File -> Self-Assessment -> Export to file...</b>
        <br/><br/>
        You have to choose a filename under which the report will be saved. The exported file is always encrypted, so you also
        have to choose a password or a certificate for encryption. Once you're done, press OK.
