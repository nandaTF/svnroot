First you have to create a new self assessment. You should be in the self assessment perspective. 
If not, you can go there by choosing from the menu:
            <b>View -> Show Perspective... -> Self-Assessment Perspective</b>.
            
            You will find the <b>Self-Assessment</b> view on left side of the Window.

        Now it's time to start the self-assessment. The top node should already
        be expanded. If it isn't please do so now. You should be able to see a
        number of categories from "Security Policy" to "Access Control". These
        categories contain questions that will help you to evaluate your current
        information security level for the most important topics.
        <br/>
        Expand the first category by clicking the expand-icon to the left of
        it.
