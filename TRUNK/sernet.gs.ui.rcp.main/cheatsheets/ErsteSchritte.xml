	<item title="Switch to ISM perspective">
	<description>
	Since you're reading this in English, we assume that you wish to use the ISM perspective. 
	This perspective allows you to model requirements and controls, to calculate risk and generate reports. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Open the ISM perspective now by clicking on the menu "View, Open Perspective, ISM Perspective".

		<description>
			First you need to download a control catalog. Some free catalogs are available from the verinice website.
			You can also create your own catalogs using Excel or StarCalc and import them into verinice.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Use your web browser to go to
			<br/>
			Adresse: <b>http://www.verinice.org/Downloads.48.0.html</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Download the catalog "Free ISO 27001 implementation guidance".
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Save the file on your hard drive.

	<item title="Create a scope">
	<description>
	The catalog is now being loaded. When the parser has finished, you will see the contents in the catalog view.
	<br/><br/>
	Open the browser view ("View, Open view, Object Browser"). Click on a control to show its contents in the browser view.
	<br/><br/>
	To actually work with the imported controls, you have to create your organization in the database. Go to the view "Information Security Model".
	It should be displayed in the middle of the verinice workbench. Click on the rightmost button ("Create new organization"). 
	Drag some controls from the catalog view to the "Controls" group underneath your new organization. The controls will be created. 
	Double-click on them to open the editor for each control.
