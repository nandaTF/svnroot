			This tutorial will show you how to accomplish a risk 
			assessment based on the international standards ISO 27005 with verinice. Let&apos;s get started.

       title="Change to the ISM perspective">
    <description>
       First, you have to switch to the ISM perspective. If you have not done so already, choose this perspective by 
       selecting it from the menu: "View -&gt; Show Perspective -&gt; ISM Perspective"

       title="Create a new scope">
    <description>
       Create a new scope by clicking the &quot;Add New Organization&quot; icon in the 
       ISM view. It looks like an empty sheet with a yellow star in the top right corner.
       <br/><br/>
       Double click on the scope. Change its name to &quot;My Organization&quot;. 
       Set the &quot;Risk Acceptance" levels&quot; to &quot;3&quot; for confidentiality, 
       integrity and availability.
       Save your changes by clicking on &quot;File -&gt; Save&quot; or by pressing Ctrl+S.
       <br/><br/>
       Scroll down and read through the definitions of business impact, threat and 
       vulnerability levels. You will have to change these to fit your actual organization later.

 <item
       title="Create a new asset">
    <description>
       Expand the scope object. Right-click on the &quot;Asset&quot; category. 
       Choose &quot;Add New Asset...&quot;. Enter &quot;Mail server&quot; as title and 
       change the type of the asset to &quot;Physical&quot;. Save by pressing Ctrl+S.
    </description>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Create a new process">
    <description>
       Right-click on &quot;Processes&quot;. Choose &quot;Add Process...&quot;. 
       Enter &quot;Marketing&quot; as title and set the "Business Impact" 
       to &quot;Confidentiality: Public&quot;, &quot;Integrity: Normal&quot;, &quot;Availability: High&quot;. 
       Save by pressing Ctrl+S.
       <br/><br/>
       Link your asset to the process: one way to do this is located in the 
       editor view: open the &quot;Relations to:&quot; checkbox and 
       choose &quot;Asset&quot;. Click &quot;Add...&quot;.  Select your asset and click &quot;OK&quot;. 
       The caption will show &quot;depends on&quot; now - meaning the process &quot;Marketing&quot; depends 
       on a functioning &quot;Mail Server&quot; to work.
    </description>

 <item
       title="Create a new vulnerability">
    <description>
       Right-click on the "Vulnerability" category in the ISM view. Choose &quot;Add Vulnerability...&quot;. 
       Enter &quot;Remote exploit&quot; as title and set the "Vulnerability Level" to &quot;1: Low&quot;. Save by pressing Ctrl+S.
    </description>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Create a new threat">
    <description>
       Right-click on the &quot;Threats&quot; category. Choose &quot;Add Threat...&quot;. 
       Enter &quot;External attacker&quot; as title and set the "Likelihood" level to &quot;4: Daily&quot;. 
       Save by pressing Ctrl+S.
    </description>

 <item
       title="Create a new scenario">
    <description>
       So far, you have created separate objects, you have not yet connected them with 
       each other to represent an actual risk scenario. Let&apos;s do that now: connect 
       the threat you have just created with the vulnerability to create a new scenario: 
       use your mouse to drag and drop the threat over to the scenario in the ISM view.
       <br/><br/>
       Now verinice asks you if you want to create a new scenario, click &quot;Yes&quot;. 
       The new object should appear under the &quot;Scenarios&quot; group. If it doesn&apos;t, press 
       Ctrl+F5 to refresh your view.
    </description>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Connect scenario and asset">
    <description>
       Now we have to connect our scenario with our mail server to show that something 
       could go wrong with it. Either drag-and-drop the scenario over to the asset or 
       open the mail server and use the &quot;Relations to&quot; drop-down to connect 
       it with your scenario.

 <item
       title="Running the risk calculation">
    <description>
       This is important: threat levels and risk values are only updated when you 
       choose the &quot;Run risk analysis&quot; button. 
       This action button is available on the upper button bar for faster access. Click on the button now!
    </description>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Check risk values">
    <description>
       Double-click on the asset, it will have inherited the business impact from 
       the &quot;Marketing&quot; process. In the &quot;Relations to&quot; list, you 
       will now see numbers next to the scenario. This means, that the scenario adds 
       to the total risk for this asset. Risk is calculated separately for 
       confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA). 
    </description>

 <item
       title="Create a second scenario (shortcut)">
    <description>
       You do not have to create an actual threat / vulnerability object for each 
       scenario that you want to take care of in verinice. You can also just 
       right-click on &quot;scenarios&quot; and choose &quot;Add scenario&quot;. 
       You can enter values for threat and likelihood of this scenario right here. 
      In this case, you should disable the checkbox &quot;Deduce from threat and vuln.&quot; to 
       prevent your settings from being overwritten on risk calculation.
<br/><br/>
If you buy verinice.PRO, you will get an extensive catalog of common scenarios
based on the threats and vulnerabilities that are contained in the annex of ISO
27005.

       title="Fine tuning the risk analysis">
    <description>
       By default, a scenario is assumed to affect all three impact categories: 
       confidentiality, integrity and availability. You can fine-tune this by 
       disabling some of the checkboxes in the scenario editor, i.e. a flood 
       affects availability, but maybe not confidentiality.
    </description>

 <item
       title="Create a risk assessment report">
    <description>
       Click on &quot;File -&gt; Generate report...&quot;. Select the 
       &quot;ISM: Risk Management Results&quot; report. Choose your scope as the top 
       level element. Select &quot;PDF&quot; as output type and select a 
       directory and a filename to save the report to. Click "OK". You can 
       open the generated report with any PDF viewer.
    </description>

 <item
       title="Risk Treatment">
    <description>
       Now we have to do something about the identified risks. Create a new 
       control by right-clicking on &quot;Controls -&gt; Add Control...&quot;. 
       Enter &quot;Patch Management&quot; as title, set &quot;Implemented&quot; 
       to &quot;Yes&quot;. Scroll down to &quot;Control Strength&quot; and &quot;Probability 
       of scenario&quot;.Choose there &quot;Reduces 1 level&quot;. Save by pressing Ctrl+S.
    </description>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Applying controls">
    <description>
       Create a relation between the control and the scenario.
<br/><br/>
Controls can be applied to a scenario or to single assets. The control 
will thereby reduce the impact of a risk towards individual assets or for 
all assets that are affected by a scenario.
<br/><br/>
If you double-click on the scenario in the list, you will see all relations 
from the scenarios side. For instance, the link to the control should 
read "likelihood reduced by" "Patch Management". The control will 
be displayed as a green checkmark to show that is already implemented.
