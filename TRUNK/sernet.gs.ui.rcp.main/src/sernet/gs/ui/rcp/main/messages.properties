Activator_10= The migration of the database to a new version may take some time. If this action takes longer than five minutes, you should migrate their database from Derby to PostgreSQL. If this is already done, you should tune the database settings. You can find more information in the FAQ on http://verinice.org/. Above a certain size of database, the use of the verinice.PRO server becomes essential. You will also find more information about verinice.PRO on our website.

ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor_1= Long version: Verinice will look for updates on every start, opening a simple HTTP connection to the webserver updates.verinice.org. If there are any updates, you will be asked if you want to install them. \nYou can disable automatic update in the preferences, but we recommend that you leave it on, so you can benefit from functional and security updates. \nVerinice will not send any data about your computer or your configuration to the update server and will not install anything without your express permission! \n\nShort version: Verinice does not "phone home" and will not install any trojan software. ;-)
