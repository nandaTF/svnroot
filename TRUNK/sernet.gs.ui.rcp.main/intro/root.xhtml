<h1>Welcome to verinice!</h1>

This tool will assist you in implementing and maintaining an information security management system (ISMS) based on national and international standards
such as <i>ISO 27001</i>. It will help you to carry out and document the necessary steps but it <b>does not replace the necessary knowledge
and management skills of the information security officer!</b> verinice is an expert tool, designed to assist CISOs as well as 
internal and external auditors in their daily work.</p>

<p>
verinice supports the ISO 27001 approach and the German baseline protection standard published by the BSI(Germany). You can also 
work with other standards (COBIT, PCI-DSS...) by importing your own catalogs in a simple Excel / StarCalc format.
